        "  - **BERT (Encoder)**: Ideal for classification (e.g., sentiment analysis), question-answering, summarization, and named entity recognition.\n",

        "  - BERT employs the encoder part of the transformer architecture.\n",
        "  - It focuses on understanding semantic and syntactic language information.\n",
        "  - BERT's output consists of embeddings, rather than predicted next words.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Application of Embeddings**:\n",
        "  - To use these embeddings, additional layers (e.g., for text classification or questions and answers) need to be added on top of BERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Training Technique**:\n",
        "  - BERT utilizes a unique training method to circumvent the need for expensive labeled data.\n",
        "  - This involves using a technique called Self-Supervised Learning, particularly effective with large data volumes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Masked Language Model**:\n",
        "  - In BERT’s training, sentences are altered by masking words.\n",
        "  - Example: **\"Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her friend that night.\"** becomes **\"Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her MASK that night.\"**\n",
        "  - These masks help BERT generate its own labeled data from originally unlabeled data.\n",

        "  - The outputs from decoders are words accompanied by their respective probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use of Attention Mechanisms**:\n",
        "  - Decoders implement the attention concept twice during the model training process.\n",
        "  - Initially, they use Masked Multi-Head Attention, similar to BERT's MASK concept. Here, only the initial words of a target sentence are shown to the model to facilitate learning without 'cheating'.\n",
        "  - Subsequently, the decoder employs Multi-Head Attention, akin to what is used in encoders.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interaction with Encoders in Transformer Models**:\n",
        "  - In models combining encoders and decoders, there's a technique where the encoder's output (keys and values) is fed into the decoders.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **GPT's Unique Approach**:\n",
        "  - GPT deviates from this technique by using only a decoder.\n",
        "  - Trained on massive datasets (Large Language Model), GPT's knowledge is embedded in billions of parameters.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Prompt Template**: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial.\n",

        "- **Memory**: Provides a construct for storing and retrieving messages during a conversation which can be either short term or long term.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Indexes**: Help LLMs interact with documents by providing a way to structure them. LangChain provides Document Loaders to load documents, Text Splitters to split documents into smaller chunks, Vector Stores to store documents as embeddings, and Retrievers to fetch relevant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Chain**: Probably the most important component of LangChain is the Chain class. It's a wrapper around the LLM that allows you to create a chain of actions.\n",

        "- **Agents**:: Agents are the most powerful feature of LangChain. They allow you to combine LLMs with external data and tools.\n",

            "Great, let me explain how Attention Mechanism works in a neural network! 🧠\n",
            "Attention is a technique used in deep learning models to allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input data when making predictions or decisions. It helps the model to selectively concentrate on the most relevant pieces of information, instead of using a fixed context or considering the entire input equally important. 🔍\n",
            "So, let's break it down step-by-step:\n",
            "1️ Step 1: The Attention Mechanism takes the input data (e.g., a sentence) and splits it into multiple segments called \"keys,\" \"values,\" and \"queries.\" These keys, values, and queries are vectors of different lengths, typically with the same dimensionality.\n",
            "2️ Step 2: The queries are used to compute a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are learned during training and reflect the relative importance of each key for the given query. This process is repeated for multiple queries, resulting in a set of weighted sums.\n",
            "3️ Step 3: The final output of the attention mechanism is a vector that represents the weighted sum of all the query-specific computations. This vector is then passed through a nonlinear activation function to produce the final output.\n",
            "Now, here's a simple example to illustrate this process:\n",
            "Suppose we have a sequence of words: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" We want to predict the next word in the sequence. Given these inputs, the attention mechanism will compute the weighted sum of the queries (i.e., the attention scores).\n",
            "4️ Step 4: To compute the attention scores, the model first computes the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "5️ Step 5: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "6️ Step 6: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "7️ Step 7: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "8️ Step 8: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "9️ Step 9: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "10️ Step 10: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "111️ Step 11: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "16️ Step 12: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "17️ Step 13: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
            "19️ Step 15: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the attention scores between the queries.\n",
